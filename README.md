# Bootstrap-Portfolio
## A bio with a portfolio of my work, with CSS and Bootstrap.
### This is intended to grow through the course of my coding bootcamp.

* Written in HTML, with Bootstrap, Owl Carousel and custom JavaScript and CSS.
* The index.html page contains short About Me & Skills cards to serve as a teaser CV.
* The portfolio.html features a carousel style card deck with several links to other repositories of mine, published on GitHub Pages.
* The contact.html contains a form card and a little 'thanks for visiting' card.
  * Form input is now interactive and stores information locally, until I learn some back-end skills.

**More to come in the future**
