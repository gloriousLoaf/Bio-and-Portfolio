# Bootstrap-Portfolio
## A bio with a portfolio of my work, with CSS and Bootstrap.
### This is intended to grow through the course of my coding bootcamp.

* Written in HTML, with Bootstrap, Owl Carousel and custom JavaScript / jQuery and CSS.
* Developed mobile-first and fully resizeable.
* The index.html page contains short About Me & Skills cards to serve as a teaser CV.
* The portfolio.html features a carousel style card deck of projects. The images link to the deployed page, with links to the repositories below their brief descriptions.
  * This will be updated as new projects are completed.
* The contact.html contains a form card and a little 'thanks for visiting' card.
  * Contains links to my GitHub and LinkedIn, where my resume is hosted.
  * Form input is now interactive. Valid submissions trigger a Modal and storesinformation locally, until I learn some back-end skills.

**More to come in the future**
