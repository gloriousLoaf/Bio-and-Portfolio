# Bootstrap-Portfolio
## A bio with a portfolio of my work, with CSS and Bootstrap.
### This is intended to grow through the course of my coding bootcamp.

* The project is all html and css with bootstrap.
* This index.html page contains short About Me & Skills cards to serve as a teaser CV.
* The portfolio.html features a card deck with three links to other repositories of mine, published on GitHub Pages.
  * This page will grow, and the repos featured in the deck will certainly change once I build better projects : )
  * Perhaps I will restyle it to something fancier, like a carousel.
* The contact.html contains a form card and a little 'thanks for visiting' card.
  * Form input goes no where for now, until I learn some back-end skills.

**More to come in the future**
