## üìù Description
To view my portfolio, please visit [metcalf.dev](https://metcalf.dev).
This is a constantly updated and evolving portfolio, serving as an introduction to my work and progress in full stack development. This currently uses **Bootstrap, jQuery, Owl Carousel, and custom JavaScript & stylesheet.**
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## üíæ Installation
If you are interested, feel free to clone this repo and use it for inspiration in your own portfolio. Though I doubt that is why you are here viewing this README. Thanks by the way for checking out my work!
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## üì≤ Usage
Visitors to my site can view some select works from my portfolio; both the GitHub repositories and deployed sites. There is a short bio section to introduce myself. And finally there is a contact form to allow visitors to quickly send my an email without leaving the site. Additionally there are links to view my LinkedIn, GitHub and Twitter, or access me via email in their preferred method.
